# Vue-3-reactivity-demo

## Intro
This demo script is based off of the course from VueMastery: [Vue 3 Reactivity](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/vue-3-reactivity/vue3-reactivity).
This is a part of my goal to help demonstrate how Vue 3 reactivity works with a Confluence write up and, extra, a code demo which is based off from the course. This is also helping me learn about Vue 3's reactivity too, so I would like to share the knowledge with the team!
